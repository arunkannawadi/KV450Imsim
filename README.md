i# KV450Imsim

This is the private GitHub repository that hosts the image simulation pipeline for KiDS-VIKING-450
shear calibration. 

All the development happens in the dev branch, which after confirmed to work well, gets pulled on to
the master branch, after a pull request is raised and approved. That way, 'master' branch always works and doesn't break annoying everyone.

Please do not upload PDFs/compressed files/data/images on the repo. Config files are fine. Catalogues
in ASCII format could be uploaded only as a sample. They don't live here. It might be good to
include .fits and .pdf etc in gitignore file.
